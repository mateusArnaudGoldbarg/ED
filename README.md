# ED
## Search and Sort Algorithms
Here you will find all the algorithms used in Data Structure classes 

- Search Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Sort Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge sort

To compile use:
```
g++ ed.cpp -o ed
```
To run use
```
./ed
```

## ADT - Abstract Data Type (TAD)
In tad folder you will find the implementation of some ADTs using classes in C++

  - Maior: It is a ADT that store an array of integers and contain a method to return the greatest element inside it
    - To compile and run it use:
    - ```bash compile_n_run.sh```
  
## Pointers
In ponteiros folder you will find basic examples of pointers in C++
  - main.cpp contain a basic implementation of pointers
  - aloc.cpp contain a basic implementation of dynamic memory allocation

## Struct
In struct folder you will find basic examples fo how to use struct in C++
  - main.cpp contain a baic implementation of a struct called Pessoa
  - lista.cpp contain an example of creating a list using struct and pointers
  - list_aloc.cpp contain an example of creating a list with struct and pointers using dynamic memory allocation
